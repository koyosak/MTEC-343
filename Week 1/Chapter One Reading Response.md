# Chapter One Reading Response

## 2 things I didn't know

#### The first thing I didn't know is the idea of being improvisational with computer. This idea was very new to me. The book was also talking about how you have conversations with computers and how you perform transparently to the audience. Because I don't know so much about live coding, those ideas were very new to me and I was very fasinated by how the author described.
#### The second thing I didn't know was that the live coding is just like performing any kinds of music in terms of people interacting with the world and each other in real time. When I heard of live coding, I got intimidated at first, but this book made me realize that live coding is just like me performing any kinds of music, but I'm just using code instead of using key on the piano. I also liked how the author said this line "Live coding is about making software live."

## 2 things I already knew

#### I don't know if it can count as what I already know, but as I read through this book, I realized how learning how to perform live coding might not only be helpful for you to understand about the computer and its language in many different ways, but also gives th computer and its software more potentials. Then I saw the similar statement and I couldn't agree more.

#### One other thing I knew was that the live coding is something that you can't actually define and it's rather an adventurous and experimental performance.
